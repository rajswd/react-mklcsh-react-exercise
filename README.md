[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-mklcsh)

#The following exercise is done in this project 
1. Login :
    > User has to provide any name and password to login. Once user login a store will be created (Redux) which will have the user detail.       As it is dummy now, storing only user name in the store. If required we can add other property in the user object as well, that's         why storing as an object.
2. Routing
   > Once user is logged in, they will able to see Home page, added nav bar component to  navigate in diffrent page.
3. Redux
  > If userr Add employee , it will store in Redux, and in home page, it will display all the added employee list.
  > From Employee list user can delete employee record as well.  Once it will deleted will be store in diffrent store(i.e. LogReducer).
    And user able to see all the deleted Employee under deleted employee list
